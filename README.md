# Udacity-Relational_Data_Modeling
Udacity - Relational Data Modeling with PostgresSQL
# Problem Statement:
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.
# Implementation Details
This project is aimed at creating a data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. 
To complete data modeling, this project defines fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
This project aims at testing your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.
